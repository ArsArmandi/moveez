# Infrastructure
We are using Azure for all our infrastructure needs. All in all we are using the following services:
* `AKS` (as described in folder `aks`)
* `ACS` (extending AKS)
* `Azure DNS` (as described in folder `network`)
* `MongoDB` (as described in folder `database`)

We are planning to use:
* `linkerd.io` as service mesh
